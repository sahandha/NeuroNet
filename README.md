# Agent based model of a network of neurons.


## Tuesday April 18 2017

Neurons are self excited (due to noise). For some network configurations, we have synchronization, see [HERE](https://github.com/sahandha/NeuroNet/blob/master/NeuronModel/Demo-Copy2.ipynb). 
When the network is too weak, no synchronization happens, see [HERE](https://github.com/sahandha/NeuroNet/blob/master/NeuronModel/Demo-Copy3.ipynb). 

***

We build a network of neurons that can form synapses over time. When a single neuron is excited, throught the connections formed, all the other neurons are excited as well. 
See the file [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/sahandha/NeuroNet/blob/master/examples/demo.ipynb) in the examples folder for a sample simulation.
