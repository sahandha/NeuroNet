# Individual Based Network of Neurons

This branch is used to run serial code on Bluewaters. This is useful for running many smaller simulations with varying parameters. Again the simulation is performed using the vectorized model which is maintained in [./NeuronModel](./NeuronModel).

For a sample study done using this module, see the [This PDF document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Kj2q2e-3SDOHp3Rk5UR0M3VFE/view?usp=sharing).
